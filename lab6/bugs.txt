Bug list:

1. The isEmpty() function always returns true;
2. There are memory leaks.
3. The addBack() function behaves just like addFront(). You can tell this by printing the list after multiple calls to addBack().
4. The removeFront() function doesn't really remove from the list. This can be verified by printing the list after calling it several times.
5. The removeBack() function doesn't really remove from the list. This can be verified by printing the list after calling it several times.
